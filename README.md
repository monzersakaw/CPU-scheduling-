# CPU-scheduling-
Analyzed various CPU scheduling algorithms including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin (RR), and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ).
Developed simulations for each scheduling algorithm to assess their performance.
Demonstrated how algorithms like SJF and Priority Scheduling can improve system performance by minimizing waiting times and prioritizing critical tasks.
Showed how Round Robin ensures fair CPU allocation among processes and how MLFQ dynamically adjusts priorities to enhance system responsiveness.
